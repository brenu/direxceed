# DirExceed

## What it is

DirExceed is a tool that, given a txt wordlist, looks for existing directories inside a domain/website.

## Project stage

At the present moment, DirExceed can take a test.txt file and check if the URLs inside are valid, but it's not the project reason, so it's definitely not complete yet.
